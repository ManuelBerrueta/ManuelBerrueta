## `whoami`
Hello 👋 I'm Manny,   
     
I am very lucky and blessed that I get to work in Offensive Security (🔴Red Teaming, 🟣Purple Teaming + 👨‍💻 AppSec) and solve security challenges at scale which I love and passion. I also enjoy working with 🔵 Blue Teams, Threat Intel, and Incident Responders as well as providing support in Software and Services Incident Response Plan(s) ([SSIRPs](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/06/inside-the-msrc-anatomy-of-a-ssirp-incident/)) and other endeavors.    

Within my GitHub you will find tools and reference materials/docs that I use to help me along in my mission 😉
