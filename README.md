## `whoami`
Hello 👋 I'm Manny,   
     
I am very lucky and blessed that I get to work in Offensive Security (🔴Red Teaming, 🟣Purple Teaming + AppSec) and solve security challenges at scale which I love and passion. I also enjoy helping Blue Teams, Threat Intel, and Incident Responders in support of Software and Services Incident Response Plan ([SSIRP](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/06/inside-the-msrc-anatomy-of-a-ssirp-incident/)) and other endeavors.    

Within my GitHub you will find tools and reference materials/docs that I have used or still use to help me do my work as well as some PoCs.
