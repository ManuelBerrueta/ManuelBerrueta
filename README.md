Hello 👋 I'm Manny,   

I am a seasoned Offensive Security professional specializing in 🔴 Red Team, 🟣 Purple Team, and 👨‍💻 Application Security (AppSec) operations. Solving security challenges at scale is not just my profession, but my passion. I thrive on the complexity and impact of this work, which I truly love doing.

I also enjoy working with 🔵 Blue Teams, 🕵️‍♂️ Threat Intel, and 👻 Incident Responders as well as providing support in Software and Services Incident Response Plan(s) ([SSIRPs](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/06/inside-the-msrc-anatomy-of-a-ssirp-incident/)) and other endeavors.  

Within my GitHub you will find tools, reference materials and documentation that I use to help me along in my mission 😉
