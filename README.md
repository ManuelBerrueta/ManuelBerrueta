Hello 👋 I'm Manny,   

I’m an experienced Offensive Security professional specializing in Red Team and Purple Team operations, with a background in Application Security (AppSec) engagements. I love tackling security challenges and engineering solutions, and I thrive on the complexity and impact of my work!

In addition, I have the pleasure of collaborating with Blue Teams, Threat Intelligence, and Incident Responders, while also supporting Software and Services Incident Response Plans ([SSIRPs](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/06/inside-the-msrc-anatomy-of-a-ssirp-incident/)) and contributing to various other initiatives.

Within my GitHub, you’ll find tools, reference materials, and documentation that support me in my mission 🚀.
